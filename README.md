# ConeDetection
This repo is part of a miniproject from ROB7 AAU. This miniproject focused on comparing traditional computer vision techniques with a neural network, in the context of detecting cones. The RT-DETR neuralnetwork can be found [here](https://github.com/KMH19/YOLOV7-8-RTDETR).

## Usage
To use this repo you must adapt the "image_pipeline.py" to use the correct path to the template and dataset. [FSOCO](https://www.fsoco-dataset.com/) has a great dataset that that is free to use.
